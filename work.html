            <p class="s3-text">In his work "Geodesia" he writes that he determined the geographical latitude of the city
                of Cat in 990.
                It is known that in order to determine geographic latitude, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge
                of geography, mathematics and astronomy. He comes to the city of Ray (near present-day Tehran). In Rai,
                he met the famous scientist - mathematician and astronomer al-Khojandi, physician and philosopher
                ar-Razi. Beruni Rayda writes his treatise "Al-Fakhri sextant". 997 Beruni returned to Kat. During this
                period, there were changes in Khorezm, Ma'mun died and Ali ibn Ma'mun came to the throne in his place.
                In 997, the famous physician Abu Ali Ibn Sina also came to Urganj.</p>

            <p class="s3-text text1">998 Beruni came to Jurjan. He lived in Jurjan until 1004. He created about fifteen
                of his works here. In
                particular, the scientist's work "Relics of Ancient Peoples" was written here around 1000. Beruni
                returned to Khorezm in the spring of 1004. At this time, the capital of Khorezm was Urganj. In Urganj he
                observed a lunar eclipse. Al-Masihi, doctor al-Hammar, Ibn Iraq and others worked in the palace.</p>

            <p class="s3-text text1">In Urganj, Beruni dealt with mathematics, astronomy, as well as some problems of
                physics and mineralogy.
                It was here that the idea of ​​using specific gravities to identify minerals and systematize them was
                born.</p>

            <p class="s3-text text1">In the summer of 1017, by order of the Turkish king Mahmud Ghaznavi, Beruni was
                taken to Ghazna as a
                prisoner. He lived there in difficult conditions. After 1019, he reached the condition of doing
                scientific work. In 1022-1024 Mahmud took Beruni with him during his march to India. Even during the
                trip, Beruni studied science. He measured the length of one degree of the meridian of the globe near the
                fort of Nandna in Punjab, and it was 110,895 km. found out that If this information is compared with the
                result of modern measurements - 111.1 km, it can be seen how accurate Beruni's measurements are. He
                spent most of his life in Ghazna, then the capital of the Ghaznavid state in present-day southeastern
                Afghanistan. While traveling to the Indian subcontinent, he wrote a treatise on Indian culture called
                Tarikh al-Hind (History of India) in 1030 after studying the Hindu religion practiced in India. He was a
                remarkably unbiased writer for his time. The customs and beliefs of various peoples, and his scientific
                objectivity earned him the title of al-Ustad ("The Teacher") for his excellent portrayal of India in the
                early 11th century.</p>

            <p class="s3-text text1">Beruni's rich scientific heritage has not yet been fully explored. Beruni studied
                Euclidean geometry and
                Ptolemy's astronomical teachings from the great scientist Abu Nasir ibn Iraq. Until 995, he solved the
                practical problems of astronomy, geography, geodesy, made a globe of the Earth and the sky, and wrote
                several books on astronomy. One such work of the scientist "Geodesia" was completed in 1025. This work
                is about "setting the boundaries of places to determine the distances between cities". At the end of the
                4th chapter of the book, Beruni thought about measuring the size of the Earth's circumference. Since
                ancient times, people have been interested in knowing the shape and size of the Earth, and different
                peoples have imagined the shape of the Earth in different ways. </p>

                                <strong>Great scientists such as Pythagoras, Aristotle, Archimedes, Eratosthenes, who
                                    passed before Christ, expressed the opinion that the Earth is round and spherical.
                                    For example, in 250 BC, the Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes said that the Earth
                                    is spherical and determined its dimensions as follows. He measured the distance
                                    between the cities of Alexandria and Sienia (now Aswan) by the duration of the
                                    caravans, then divided this value by the difference of the latitudes of the two
                                    cities and calculated the radius of the Earth as 6,840 kilometers. The length of the
                                    meridian arc is 119,444 degrees, or the length of the meridian arc is 70,121, and he
                                    calculated that this arc is 1/50 of the length of the meridian circle. He came to
                                    the opinion that the length of the Earth's meridian circle is about 39,500
                                    kilometers. After Eratosthenes, a number of Egyptian, Chinese and Greek scientists
                                    determined the size of the Earth using Eratosthenes' method. In the Middle Ages,
                                    scientists from our country made great contributions in determining the size of the
                                    Earth. Musa Muhammad al-Khorazmi proved that the length of one degree meridian arc
                                    is equal to 111.8 kilometers.</strong>
