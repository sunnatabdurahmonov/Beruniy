            <p class="s3-text"> Central Asian scientists such as Khorezmi, Farghani, Habash Khasib, Marvaridi worked in
                various fields
                in the Academy of Sciences of that time named "Donishmandlik Uyi" established in Baghdad. Beruni was
                also a member of this "House of Wisdom" and worked there for 7 years. According to him, according to the
                order of Caliph Ma'mun, scientists of the "House of Wisdom" were divided into two groups and began to
                determine the size of the Earth based on the degree measurement method in the Sanjar desert west of
                Mosul, Iraq. Each group calculated the length of one degree meridian arc based on the results they
                measured. According to the calculations of the first group, the length of one degree meridian arc is
                equal to 111,815 kilometers, the value found by the second group was 1315 meters less. Beruni says that
                the reason for this difference between the results is two different measurements, and he is interested
                in checking these results and wants to carry out degree measurement work.</p>

            <p class="s3-text">
                For this, he chose the steppe of Dehistan (the southeastern part of the Caspian Sea), but he could not
                do it because he did not have an assistant and sufficient funds. To determine the size of the earth by
                the degree measurement method, a flat area of ​​a certain latitude is needed, and several tens of
                kilometers must be accurately measured here. This work required a lot of time, a lot of money and
                careful preparation. About this, Beruni said: "The length of the Earth's circumference can be determined
                as follows without traveling through the desert. For this purpose, by climbing a high mountain on the
                seashore or in a flat area, before sunrise or sunset, when half of the sun's halo is between the
                horizon, its angle of descent is measured with a circular armillary instrument. Explains the method of
                measuring horizon dip using graphs and formulas. In this case, the angle formed by the line of sight
                with the horizontal line passing through the top of the mountain, depending on the sunrise or sunset, is
                measured.
            </p>
            <p class="s3-text">
                Abu Rayhan Beruni used a new method to measure the size of the Earth and calculated that the length of
                one degree meridian arc is 111.16 kilometers. Beruni accurately measured the radius of the Earth for
                that period. He calculated the length of the Earth's meridian circle to be 40,183 kilometers. During one
                of his trips to India, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi took Beruni with him, and on the way he had to stay
                temporarily in the city of Molton in eastern Pakistan. Despite being in a foreign country, he took the
                opportunity to measure the Earth's surface at Nandna Fort, 400 kilometers west of Molton, first
                measuring the geographical latitude of the place and finding it to be 320001. It then measures the angle
                of dip of the horizon. The scientist himself writes about it as follows: "I had to live in the Nandna
                fortress in India. I saw a high mountain on the west side of the fortress, and a wide desert on the
                south side, and at that moment I began to try (the method of measuring the dip of the horizon). From the
                top of the mountain, I clearly saw that the earth was connected with the blue sky. The line of sight
                descends 00 341 from a line perpendicular to the vertical. I measured the height of the mountain
                perpendicularly, and it was equal to 652,055 longi (gaz) in the measure used here.'
            </p>
            <p class="s3-text">
                By his own method, Beruni calculated that the length of the radius of the Earth's sphere is equal to
                12803337.036 gas. If we consider that one gas is 0.4933 meters, the length of the radius of the Earth's
                sphere, according to Beruni, is 6315.886 kilometers. This number is very little different from the value
                obtained at the present time, that is, the error is 0.9% of the length of the radius. Then Beruni
                calculates that the length of one degree meridian arc of this 320,001 latitude is 223,550.329 gas or
                110,277 kilometers. If we compare this number with the current value of one degree of arc of 110,885
                kilometers, it will be known that Beruni made a mistake of only 618 meters in calculating the length of
                one degree of arc a thousand years ago. Determining the length of the Earth's circumference, as Beruni
                said, is more accurate and convenient than determining the length of 10 arcs by wandering through the
                deserts. Therefore, using trigonometric methods, he achieved a more accurate result than previous
                astronomers in measuring the height of the mountain. Beruni says the following about finding the length
                of the Earth's circumference: "In order to find the length of the Earth's circumference, in all cases,
                double the radius, multiply by 22, and divide the resulting product by 7, and the length of the Earth's
                circumference will be obtained in the units you measured."
            </p>

            <p class="s3-text">
                By performing the actions mentioned by Beruni, it is possible to calculate the length of the circle
                λ=2πR. It represents 22/7=3.14... Thus, Beruni personally calculated the geographical latitudes of
                several cities. For example, the width of Ghazna is 330 351, that of Kanda is 330 551, that of Dumpur is
                340 201. According to his calculations, the width of the city of Bukhara is found to be 390 201.
                Currently, this value is 390,461. So it differs from Beruni's account by only 00 261. Therefore,
                studying the scientific and cultural heritage of our great grandfather Abu Rayhan Beruni and conveying
                it to pupils and students is one of our ancient values. Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad Beruni was one of
                the great encyclopedic scholars of the Middle Ages. His greatness is reflected in the unique scientific
                heritage he contributed to almost all sciences of that time. I. Yu. Krachkovskiy, a famous orientalist,
                assessed Beruni's scientific potential by saying that "it is easier to list the fields of science that
                he is not interested in than the fields of science that he is interested in." M. Meyerhoff, one of the
                Western researchers, expresses the opinion that "Biruni should be the most famous of the encyclopedic
                scholars who demonstrate Muslim science."
